# Big Immich

**Community tvOS app for Immich (Apple TV)**

> A simple, free community app to display Immich photo and video slideshows on your Apple TV.

This is a **community-driven project** and is **not affiliated with Immich**.

## 🎯 Why Big Immich exists

Showing photos and videos from Immich on a TV used to be surprisingly painful:
* AirPlay from a browser was unreliable
* HDMI cables were inconvenient
* Immich had (or maybe still has) some bugs with showing slideshow
* Existing alternatives were not working at all or required paid subscriptions just to show slideshows (why?!)

Big Immich was created to solve exactly one problem: **a simple, reliable way to enjoy Immich albums on an Apple TV**.

## ✨ App goals

The main goals of Big Immich are intentionally focused:

* 📺 Display slideshows from **existing Immich albums**
* 🎛️ Easily control which albums are visible on the TV
* 🏠 Make it safe and convenient for **household use**
* 🚀 Stay lightweight, fast, and easy to use

This app is **not trying to replace the Immich web UI** or be a full-featured client.

## 🚀 Quick start

### App Store

The easiest way to use Big Immich is via the **Apple App Store**.

> 📌 A direct App Store link will be added here once the app becomes publicly available.

### First launch

When you start the app for the first time, you will be asked to provide Immich access.

🔐 **Recommended setup**:

* Create a **separate Immich user** just for the TV
* Use an **API key** instead of email & password

This approach:

* Allows everyone in your household to share albums safely
* Prevents accidentally showing private or inappropriate content
* Avoids exposing your main Immich credentials on a shared device
