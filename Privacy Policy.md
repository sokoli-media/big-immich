Big Immich (“we”, “our”, or “the App”) is an unofficial, community-made Apple TV application for viewing photos and videos hosted on an Immich server. We value your privacy and want you to understand what data is collected and how it is used.

1. Information We Collect

ImmichTV Client does not collect personal data by default. The app only interacts with the Immich server you provide.

Crash reporting (optional):
 - If you enable crash reporting (via Sentry), anonymous crash logs may be sent to help us improve the app.
 - Crash reports do not include your media content or personal identifiers unless you explicitly provide them.
 - IP addresses may be sent to Sentry servers temporarily for crash reporting.

Other data:
 - The app does not track users across apps.
 - The app does not collect analytics, advertising identifiers, or location data.

2. Use of Information
 - Crash reports are used only to diagnose and fix issues.
 - No data is sold or shared with third parties for advertising.
 - Media content remains only on your Immich server.

3. Third-Party Services
 - Sentry (optional crash reporting)
 - Used to collect anonymized crash logs.
 - More info: https://sentry.io/privacy/￼

4. Data Storage and Security
 - All media files remain on your Immich server — the app does not upload media elsewhere.
 - Crash logs (if enabled) are transmitted securely over HTTPS to Sentry.

5. User Choices
 - You may disable crash reporting at any time in the app settings.
 - You may stop using the app at any time; no personal data is stored by us.
