## 📋 Before You Report an Issue

To keep the issue tracker useful and actionable, please make sure the following conditions are met **before opening a new issue**:

### ✅ 1. Use the latest version of Immich

This app depends on the Immich API.

➡️ **Please update Immich to the latest stable release** before reporting any issue.

Many problems are caused by:
- API changes in older Immich versions
- Already-fixed bugs
- Schema or authentication changes

Issues reported against **outdated Immich versions may be closed** with a request to update first.

When opening an issue, please include your Immich version.

### ✅ 2. Check existing issues

Before creating a new issue:
- Search the existing issues
- Check closed issues as well

If you find a related issue, feel free to:

### ✅ 3. Provide useful details

Good bug reports help issues get fixed faster. Please include:
- tvOS version
- Apple TV model
- App version / commit hash
